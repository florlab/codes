Ofcourse I can handle for a change. Actually in my previous company our immediate manager had to quit and new project manager changed the strategy and process

7. how well do you work under pressure.
infact In one of the company that I was working, there was a project that given to us and which has to be completed in 4 days which usually takes 10 days
and the whole team just like strees out, they panic, and they just don't know what to do but then I ensure that they settle down we prioritize our work and organize matter
and also we work late night but that definitely help to submit the project in 4 days. So I think working under pressure is not bad to me
